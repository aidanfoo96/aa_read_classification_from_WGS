# Aedes aegypti microbiota Read Classification From WGS

These scripts are for my third rotation project where I classified the Aedes aegypti microbiota using whole genome sequences. The premise behind this project was to use the unaligned reads for read classification. To run the analyses, clone the the scripts located in the scripts folder. Run the 'create folders' script. This will create three folders - "Working" "Results" "Data". From the working folder, run all the required scripts in the desired order to re-run the analysis pipeline.
